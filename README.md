# House-Price-Prediction
i Implemented a house price prediction using Random Forest, i also used GridSearchCV for hyperparameteer tunning amongst others 

**DATASET**
The dataset was obtained from the California house prise dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices

**PREPROCESSING**
i viewed the data cleaned it and try to perform some feature engineering by encoding come categorical features, using pandas

**MODEL SELECTION AND BUILDING** 
i also used linear regression, but as a result of not getting my best accuracy, i decised to use an ensemble technique like random forest, which did a bit better and i optimized that using GridSearchCV
